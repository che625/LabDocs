#Ocean Acidification Research

With our labs' focus on the physiological repsonse of marine organisms to environmental change we have considerable interest in how changes in ocean chemistry impacts biology. Our efforts in this front can be categorized into 1) the organismal response to acute elevated carbon dioxide exposure and 2) the population level impact, which will be strongly influenced by local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. While our research often integrates the impact at all levels our findings and research progress is outline below based on these two biological levels. In addition to the research carried out be graduate students, undergraduate students, and scientists in Roberts Lab; research projects completed as part of courses are also hightlighted.

Collaborations: Over the years we have collaborated with several groups with primary on ongoing work with the lab of Dr. Carolyn Friedman (UW SAFS). More information on our activities can be found on our blog: Ocean Acidicition Resarch in SAFS.


## Organismal Response to Ocean Acidification

Our work began in 2009 with support from NOAA. This award entitled, _Threats to Bivalve Aquaculture and Fisheries: The Influence of Emerging Diseases and Environmental Change_ (PI Roberts) focused on ocean acidification and the interaction with oysters and vibrio.

This work continued with an award to Dr. Friedman from Washington SeaGrant, _Effects of Ocean Acidification on Declining Puget Sound Shellfish_. 

During this period, Emma Timmins-Schiffman (a graduate student in our lab primarily funded by the NOAA award) successfully raised over $5000 to fund her acidification research in [a crowdfunding effort](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/6330-save-oysters-from-ocean-acidification).

Below is list of products from our efforts.

## Ocean Acidification and Adaptive Potential 

More recently our research efforts have turned to local adaptation and how shellfish populations with resond to changes in ocean chemistry. Central to this phenonenom is our fundamental research on the role of epigenetics on phenotypic plasticy and local adaptation. Early on this work concentrated on molecular mechanisms <paper>.
