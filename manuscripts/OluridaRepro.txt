Olympia oysters, Ostrea lurida, in Puget Sound, Washington are known to initiate reproduction at a specific temperature threshold. Bays along a latitudinal gradient within the Sound exhibit temporal variation in attaining this temperature. This gradient of habitat types has been shown in recent studies (Savolainen, 2007) to induce the phenomena of local adaptation within semi sessile and sessile native organisms. Since O. lurida is native to the west coast, it is hypothesized that populations along a latitudinal gradient have become locally adapted to their environment. This adaptation would have important ramifications for conservation and restoration projects within the Puget Sound.   To test these differences we set up a reciprocal transplant experiment among three populations from Fidalgo (Northern), Dabob (Central), and Oyster (Southern) bays along a latitudinal axis as well as a fourth bay (Manchester NOAA facility) as a control repository. We monitored growth, survival, and fecundity from August 2013 to August 2014. We observed only minor growth and survival differences among populations. Throughout the spawning season, Southern oyster population produced significantly more brooding oysters at two of the three sites compared to the other two populations. Oyster populations native to these diverse bays may have genetically diverged their spawn timing to conform to environmental conditions within each bay, or the Southern population may simply have greater fitness. Through our ongoing research, we intend to determine whether Olympia oyster populations exhibit local adaptation within Puget Sound.

Methods
Broodstock Conditioning and Outplanting 
Adult oysters were collected from three locations in Puget Sound (Fidalgo, Dabob, and Oyster Bays) during November and December 2012 by Puget Sound Restoration Fund. Mass spawning of ~20-25 oysters from each location occurred in June 2013 following several months of conditioning. All offspring produced were raised and conditioned under common garden conditions such that no population received different treatment throughout the entire experiment. Larvae were raised in flowing seawater and fed microalgae. Following setting on microcultch, juveniles were cultured in flowing seawater in Port Gamble. In August 2013, 480 oysters (5-10 mm) from each population were planted at Fidalgo, Oyster Bay, Dabob, and Manchester Bays.  At each site, oysters from each population were placed into four 0.61M X 0.61M growout trays (120 each). In each tray, oysters were equally distributed in four 10x7.5cm mesh (1475 micron) bags. Trays were  anchored into substrate using using rebar stakes. In late autumn trays at Fidalgo Bay, Oyster Bay, and Manchester were transferred from substrate to a midcolumn hanging deployment.   At each site, a HOBOlogger temperature logger (OnSet, USA) was deployed to monitor temperature every 15 minutes.

Site Monitoring


Mortality
        Mortality was determined via counts of dead oysters or remaining live oysters at each site visit. Survival was assessed [d] in December 2013, January (Dabob only), February, April/May, June, and July/August 2014. 
All trays were examined winter visits and a single tray was counted during each summer visits allowing for a full population count at the end of 4 weeks. No oysters remained at Dabob after April.  


Growth
Size was assessed five times between August 2013 outplant and August 2014. Size was assessed using photos and imageJ.[e][f] Images for size were taken at every visit in February, April/May, June (subsample), and July/August 2014. 


Reproductive Activity
To assess number of larvae, one tray from each population was subjected to anesthesia (Jackson et al, in press) with larvae removed and counted. This was carried out on weekly basis from May 14th, 2014 until August 15th, 2014 . Specifically, trays were removed from water and placed on land for 45 minutes then immersed in heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O) (epsom salt) dissolved in sea water (75g/l) for 45 minutes. When brooding oysters were detected via visual inspection, larvae were flushed out using ambient sea water onto a 52 micron screen. The screen was then washed with 95% ethanol into a plastic tube (50ml) for later analysis. The number brooding adults to treated oysters was recorded.


Statistical Analysis
        Differences in mortality were determined through Cox Proportional Hazard tests performed in the R statistical package (survival). Only findings with a P-Value less that 0.05 (P<0.05) were considered different. 
        Growth was compared using ANOVA assuming normal distribution as well as Kruskal-Wallis assuming non-normal distribution. Pairwise comparisons were performed using Student’s T-Test as well as Tukey’s HSD. P-Values less than 0.05 (P<0.05) were considered different. 
        




Results




Survival
Significant differences between group mortalities were found with the Dabob group having the highest survival and Fidalgo had the lowest survival, overall. At the Fidalgo s[g]ite an average 78% of the oysters from all three cohorts remain after 10 months (Fig 1b). No significant differences in mortalities between groups were observed at Fidalgo. Limited mortality was observed at Manchester where on average 65% of cohorts remain by July 2014 (Fig 1d). No significant differences in mortalities between groups were found at Manchester.
At Oyster Bay there were significantly more mortality in all three populations [h] as compared to the Fidalgo and Manchester sites, with an average of 39% survival [i]by September 2014 (Fig 1a). At Oyster Bay Dabob had the highest survival and Oyster Bay had the lowest survival [j][k]at 11 months post outplant.

Growth
Mean oyster size at outplant was XXX (SD +-) across all sights. It should be noted that at Manchester[l][m] animals from the Dabob groups were outplanted at a slightly larger mean size (approximately 5mm more) [n]than the other two groups at outplanting.  After one year, mean size of oysters at Oyster Bay were 26, 28, and 32 [o]mm for Dabob, Oyster Bay, and Fidalgo groups respectively. At Fidalgo mean size of oysters were 23, 27, and 29[p] mm for Dabob, Oyster Bay, and Fidalgo groups. At Manchester, mean size of oysters were 18, 20, and 21 mm for Dabob, Oyster Bay, and Fidalgo groups. Gr[q]owth was observed at Dabob but was insignificant as all oysters died 8 months post outplanting.

Growth Rate[s]
         From individual sizes collected via ImageJ analysis of oyster size, growth rate was calculated using ggplot2 [t] and a best fit line calculated via linear method was overlaid to determine differences in growth rate between populations. At Oyster Bay, the Oyster Bay groups grew the slowest while the Fidalgo group grew the fastest w[u]ith Dabob in between.
At Fidalgo, all three groups grew at roughly equal rates.  At Manchester, Oyster Bay grew the fastest while Fidalgo and Dabob grew at equivalent rates.

The proportion of brooding oysters at the three field sites was assessed from May to August 2014.  At Oyster Bay and Fidalgo, the Oyster Bay group had an elevated proportion of brooding adults throughout the season. At Oyster Bay, there were 69 brooding oysters (41%_. This is in comparison to 14% and 11% brooding oysters from Fidalgo and Dabob, respectively.The peak percentage of brooding oysters in Oyster Bay was reached in third week of June in oysters from Oysters Bay, three weeks prior to peaks in other populations.

At Fidalgo Bay, Oyster Bay oysters peaked in percentage of brooder in the second week of July.  The Oyster Bay group produced 39 brooders representing 10% of the population over the course of season. The Northern and Dabob groups produced 8 brooders a piece representing ~2% of each population. [ab][ac][ad][ae][af]

Conditions at Manchester led to an underwhelming[ag] spawning season though all populations produced at least one brooder. The Southern[ah] population spawned the most and produced 11 brooders representing roughly 3% of the oysters present. Interestingly the Dabob population produced more brooders than the Northern population with 7 and 1 brooders respectively. This represented ~2% and 0.3% of each population respectively.

Size at Brooding[ai]
        Each brooder was measured in the field to determine size at brooding. These sizes were then correlated with group to determine total size at brooding[aj]. It was found that there were significant differences between each group as well as between each [ak]site. The Fidalgo group produced the largest brooders with an average size of 29 mm while the Dabob group produced the smallest brooders at 23 mm. Oyster bay produced an average size brooder of 26 mm. By site, Animals at Oyster Bay and Fidalgo Bay ranged between average size of 27-28 mm while Manchester produced the smallest average brooders at around 22 mm[al]. 








DISCUSSION


Survival Differences
        The main driver of survival at each site was the environment. The sites with the lowest mortality had the most stable temperature regimes. While Dabob, the site with the most intense temperature fluctuation and noted freezing events within the trays was completely wiped out by the end of Winter 2014. The second largest factor affecting mortality was the population of origin. A feature of the Dabob population led to significantly lower mortality than the other two groups at sites with high mortality overall. This could be a function of increased stress resilience possessed by the Dabob group. 


Mean Length Differences
        Again the main driver of growth was the outplant site with even the smallest mean length size population, Dabob, being proportional in size to the Oyster Bay and Fidalgo groups. The effect of population affected the degree to which they grew allowing the Fidalgo and Oyster Bay populations to grow the largest, while the Dabob population was the smallest at each site. We speculate that this reduced size was in part due to energetic tradeoffs Dabob oysters made in effort to prime themselves for future stressors. Production of heat shock proteins have been shown to be increased prior to stress events in populations that inhabit more stressful environments. 


Growth Rate Differences
        While growth rates were quite similar at most sites, the Fidalgo population experienced a significantly higher growth rate at Oyster Bay than it did in its bay of origin. Savolainen et al. 2007 found similar changes in growth rates of trees from more northern lattitudes and suggested that this phenomena is due to more efficient energy allocation in populations that exist in areas that limit the period of growth due to colder annual temperatures. When these populations are moved from the northern latitudes to southern, warmer latitudes the populations experience intense prolonged growth rates due to the increased length of the growing season. 


Distribution of Brooders
        Since Hopkins et al. 1936, it has been known that Ostrea lurida begin spawning at temperatures above 12.5 C. From our temperature logs and brooder information, this holds true as oysters at each site did not begin brooding until the daily minimum water temperature remained above 12.5 C for several consecutive days. The spawning threshold temperature was met at each in Mid May, Late June, and Mid-July for Oyster Bay, Fidalgo, and Manchester respectively. 
This temperature threshold determines the point after which populations in each area begin being reproductively active. Only after this point is reached does population origin begin to have an effect on brooding. If temperature determines when spawning begins, then population origin determines to what degree each population spawns. At Oyster Bay and Fidalgo, the Oyster Bay group brooded in significantly higher numbers than the Fidalgo or Dabob groups.  At Manchester, the Oyster Bay group produced the largest number of brooders but it was not significantly different from that of the Dabob group which was surprising though the overall numbers were quite low. 
The smallest observed brooder was 15 mm and the largest was above 40 mm. The majority of each population fell into the range of these two sizes suggesting that the majority of each populations was above the size threshold of 15 mm and could have been capable of spawning. 


**Fecundity (If we add this part like brent suggested)
        The majority of these samples are still being processed so no definite conclusion can be considered here just yet. However we did find that animals that spawned earlier in the season produced significantly less larvae than animals that spawned later in the season. It should also be noted that the numbers of larvae produced are similar to the findings of Hopkins et al. (1936) in which similar brooding surveys on animals ranging in ages found larvae production to be near 100,000 or more larvae per individual in each brood. 
        
I’ll also probably add some information about size at brooding. This analysis could be done by Joelle by having her take the list of counted brood samples and correlating it back with the size of the brooder it came from. I’m sure I could do a quick analysis to figure out if larger animals brooder more. 


Local Adaptation
        A main objective of this study was to determine whether the phenomena of local adaptation occurs on a scale small enough to affect Olympia oysters originating in geographically separated bays along a latitudinal gradient. From our findings we see that each of our populations expresses distinct differences in each of the three key metrics. These differences however do not seem to imbue any one population with a higher fitness within its home bay nor does it promote one population more than the others at foreign sites. Unlike Savolainen et al., we did not observe overall greater fitness of oysters from northern habitats placed in southern bays though we did see increased growth most likely due to efficient energy allocation. This allocation however did not seem to favor reproduction or homeostatic stability as we observed these features from the Oyster Bay group and Dabob group respectively. With further study we will be able to determine whether this energy allocation is genetically imprinted within each population. If so the possibility of outbreeding depression may still exist at sites where animals are outplanted and interbreed with native species. 


Implications for Restoration
        As part of the Washington Shellfish Initiative, there is a push for increased restoration activities for the native oyster species of Washington. Several restoration projects have been promoted and are currently active within the Puget Sound. These efforts include outplanting of viable larvae and seed oysters in current but diminished O. lurida population as well as sites historically known to have populations but may not currently exist. 
While most restoration efforts use broodstock collected from the bay of interest, it may be necessary at times (due to very small local populations or in historically described areas) to plant seed produced from broodstock of alternative bays. In cases such as this, two very important factors come into play which will determine the success of the restoration effort: environmental stability of site and desired traits in broodstock. 
Environmental stability affects every fitness component of outplanted animals and determines the rate of mortality, the degree of growth, and the length of the spawning season. When stability is high, most populations are fit enough to survive and reproduce. If stability is low and outplanted individuals experience extreme high or low temperatures for extended or multiple durations, the seeds will have limited to no success in establishing a self sustaining population. While no environment is ever considered perfect, we can improve the success of restoration efforts by carefully choosing broodstock populations.
Selecting desired traits in broodstock may be difficult as no population, at least within this study, has shown to have significant success in all key metrics. A good rule of thumb is to investigate and monitor a site of interest and oyster origin bay for environmental parameters such as tidal influence, minimum and maximum daily temps throughout a year or more, influence from currents or bay turnover events especially during May/June when spawning may be halted due to temperature shift, and primary productivity. The more closely the parameters match, the more likely success of outplanted individuals will be. If no origin bay can be designated, then populations with traits that correlate well with environmental challenges in bays of interest may be the best solution. 
With further genetic study, it will become more clear on whether local populations face the threat of outbreeding depression. Until it can be understood which traits are inheritable and which are made plastic by the environment, it is best treated with conservative approaches and considered possible to avoid introducing negative traits into local populations. 


Study Limitations
        There are limitations to this study that must be addressed when considering the findings such as subtidal outplantation, drastic mortality at Dabob, accidental limitation of genetic diversity, truncated reproductive sampling period. 
        First, populations were held at subtidal elevations off of floating docks at Oyster Bay, Fidalgo, and Manchester. These populations experience less tidal influence than they would have at more intertidal zones. The decision to place them at subtidal zones was due to the threat of extreme low temperature events during Winter 2014. To be able to study longterm growth and reproductive activity effectively within the study and that the subtidal elevation would affect all populations equally still allowing for comparable results. 
The only site that continued through the study at an intertidal elevation was Dabob which had no accessible floating dock. The extreme fluctuations and lows had a significant effect on mortality with all populations as over 50% of the outplanted animals were deceased 5 months after outplant. By April 2014, the Dabob site was terminally sampled and discontinued as part of the study. This restricted us from being able to compare longterm growth and reproductive activity at this site. Overall though, the extreme mortality events had did lead to finding an interesting difference between the populations as well as give a great example of how what kind of site not to select for restoration. 
Due to the nature of randomly selecting seed for outplant from larvae produced en mass, there is a possibility that genetic diversity may be due to overrepresentation of brooders with higher fecundity. This portion of the study could not address this issue directly due to the inherent need for genetic testing. Future studies will include tests for relatedness to alleviate any possible doubts about limitation of genetic diversity. 
The truncation of the reproductive sampling period was simply due to limited resources such as travel funds and time available for field work. It was noted that at Manchester, water temperatures did not hit spawning threshold until mid July. this mean that by mid August when we stopped sampling, the outplanted animals were spawning as shown by samples from the last field dates at Manchester. It was likely these animals didn’t not reach peak spawning until late August or early September. Without collection of this peak, we are unable to show whether the trend of Oyster Bay producing more broods remained true. In future studies it is suggested that brood sampling continue until at least Mid September to retain the most spawning information for late warmup sites. 


Future Research
        There are still many opportunities for data generation and analysis through the use of predictive models for fitness, multivariate analysis, fecundity counts, year two reproductive sampling and genetic analysis for population genotype. We will be conducting all of these over the coming months to better understand any underlying differences within the outplanted groups either due to environment effects of outplant site or population origin. 
        Using the predictive fitness models a quantitative fitness estimate can be generated to provide clarity upon which if any population is the most fit. We will also use multivariate analysis to determine what affected overall fitness from intrapopulation phenotypes to environmental parameters. 
        Fecundity counts will clarify which population was more successful at producing larvae for future recruitment. The year two reproductivity assays will provide insightful information on how population reproductive phenotypes change going into year two as well as any increases in larvae production.  
        The most influential future work will be the use of RAD-sequencing to produce genotype profiles of each population. These profiles can help determine whether outbreeding depression is of concern and to hopefully produce the scale to which local adaptation occurs at least within Olympia oysters in the Puget Sound. 


















Fecundity was measured through weekly reproductive surveys at Oyster Bay, Fidalgo Bay, and Manchester from May to August 2014 followed by larvae counts from each brood collected. Animals were reproductively active with oysters most active in Oyster Bay and least active in Manchester. 


Fecundity
Fecundity surveys were performed for the majority of the spawning season starting in mid May 2014 and ending in mid August 2014.  During this time weekly collection of brooding larvae from sub samples of each population at each site were performed using an anesthesia technique in the field. The technique itself varies in efficiency between sites and between trays due to things like wave motion (a common problem on the Manchester floating docks) and vibration of people walking around the tray during treatment (an issue common for both researchers and the general public at all sites). For each treatment we would have a number of effectively treated oysters and ineffectively treated oysters. Only oysters that were effectively treated ie gaping were able to be checked for brooding larvae. We calculated percent brooders based on the number of brooding individuals found divided by the number of oysters that were effectively treated. This allows us to easily compare between sites, trays, and treatment days the differences in brooding even though the pool of oysters we used to check for brooding changed frequently in each treatment. 




Historically Oyster Bay has been known for its abundant olympia oyster harvests and has a well established resident population which was sampled for the Southern population broodstock. Condition within this bay reach the spawning threshold of 12.5 C within mid May and continue a warming trend throughout the summer. This is evidenced by the brooding activity monitored in late may with the strong pulse from both the native population and the foreign populations. This activity increased steadily over the summer and crested around July 10th when the site total number of brooders was at its maximum when all brooders were combined. Though it does seem that the Southern population had its maximum spawning period in late June while the Northern and Dabob populations didn’t hit their maximum spawning until mid July. In late July and issue arose with a heavy set of blue mussels on both stacks of oysters. This seems to have a depressing effect on spawning for all populations in one stack over the other. Most likely this is caused by the blue mussels consuming the majority of the ambient food and sperm balls in the water leaving very little for the oysters to fertilize or raise larvae with. As this is a pretty common occurrence within Oyster Bay, it could be assumed that the native populations pulse occurs earlier as it is forced to compete with blue mussel settlers later in the season. 


Another telling part of this data is that given the same conditions which are very supportive of spawning at oyster bay, not all the populations spawned with the same vigor. The Southern population spawned in large numbers continuously for a generous period of time and out produced all other populations at nearly every time point. While not as vigorous, the Northern population also spawned in large numbers later in the season but had to have a gradual build up in spawning activity. Also it seemed to reduce spawning rates much faster than the other populations late in the season which may be a sign that Northern oysters shut down reproductively in the face of modest unfavorable conditions. The Dabob population only once out performed the other two populations and only did so very late in the summer. While this population has shown some evidence of being much hardier when it comes to resistance to extreme temperature fluctuations, there may be an energetic trade off when it comes to spawning leaving the oysters to produce little offspring. 






From water temperatures taken on treatment days, it seems as if Fidalgo didn’t reach the spawning threshold until July. Data from the temperature loggers refutes this. While temperatures were not optimal until June, the oysters at Fidalgo did start brooding in early June. Unlike Oyster Bay there was never a pulse with concerted and synchronized brooding across all populations. It does however seem that the Northern population attempted to brood first but was then usurped by the the Southern population which began brooding in the second week of June and remained equal to or greater than number of brooders compared to each population. From this information it seems almost as if the Southern population were heavily invested in spawning if the temperatures hold about the threshold while the other populations may be more sensitive to other parameters such as tidal influence or underwater vibrations caused by nearby boat traffic. This site has the highest survival and mediocre but steady brooding occurring in at least one of the three populations. Overall this site is an excellent site for restoration efforts which have been in progress for several years now. 


As for each population, surprisingly the southern population has had the best response in terms of brooding. This seems that these oysters are very opportunistic when it comes to spawning and will allocate more energy resources to the effort when conditions may not be the best. The native population on the other hand has had a very weak response to these conditions. This could be a sign that the population has undergone an outbreeding depression effect caused by the introduction of non native populations of olympia oysters during restoration outplanting activities. The Dabob population has also had the surprising late season spawning seen at the other three sites. Late season spawning could be indicative of divergent adaptations caused by the conditions found within Dabob bay. These oysters may weather extreme cooling events in late spring and early summer in their native bays which has lead them to delay their reproductive efforts until late summer when warmer temperatures are more stable over time. This would give these populations an advantage when brooding as to avoid any possible cold shocks that could disrupt spawning and reduce future recruitment. That said it does seem to still suggest that Dabob oysters put less energy into spawning to maintain long term survival.




Manchester was the slowest and lo[am]west spawning site all summer. While it seemingly had good parameters for survival, it negatively influenced spawning. The first spawner found at Manchester was in mid June, 3 weeks after the first pulse of spawning seen at Oyster Bay. From this point, each population only produced 1 brooder until mid July when the Southern population began having small numbers of brooders. Overall brood quality was less dense than at other sites with visibly less larvae being collected for each animal. Overall this site had a poor effect on spawning and would likely be a poor site choice for any future restoration efforts. That said the new oyster hatchery owned by NOAA and run by PSRF is based in the same bay. They have broodstock being maintained at the floating docks which is great for longterm survival but to create offspring the oysters must be conditioned in the hatchery weeks to months prior to spawning to induce fecundity.

notes
At Manchester and Fidalgo, there were relatively equivalent numbers of oysters in each population prior to spawning season. Since the four stacks contained equivalent numbers of oysters, once stack was checked each week leading to a month between each recheck on the stacks.  At Oyster bay, due to tray organization within the hanging stacks as well as a temporary loss of one stack for several months during the early period of spawning season and a accidental researcher induced mortality event in one stack, we were forced to conduct reproductive surveys on only one stack of trays until late June when the lost stack was recovered. From that point two stacks, instead of four that were normally checked. This lead to the stacks being checked every other week instead of once a month. [an]


Sampling occurred from April 30th to August 1st, 2014, with each site being visited once per week except for the week of May 4th during which water temperatures were below spawning threshold as evidenced by the lack of brooders in the week prior and the week after.














Larvae Counts/quality
[a]not--perhaps Fitness?
[b]I changed this to fitness but I'm not sure that fitness describes it either. I stated success at we can directly state that the animal was successful at reproducing. I feel that fitness indicates that the animal had the potential to reproduce but does not indicate that we were successful in proving that it did reproduce. Though I do understand that success generally implies later recruitment of offspring. Is there possibly a more neutral term to indicate breeding success but not imply future recruitment?
[c]note this will not be included in final but helps with writing.
[d]list when this occured
[e]Be specific.
[f]Should I put in a paragraph containing the protocol for ImageJ or should I just say that we compared oysters measured in images to a known size standard to calculate exact size of each individual measured?
[g]Get Letters on graphs for ease
[h]compared to ....
[i]graph does not reflect that
[j]give #s
[k]Exact numbers?
[l]use specific language
[m]I have added the specificity you requested here about which population and the increased size at outplant.
[n]no need to approx - give exact diff in mean
[o]Double Check on R
[p]Double Check on R
[q]turn this into simple table
[r]lets plan on keeping these in - fix fonts
[s]Need to produced and test Rsquare values for growth curves. I have some references to build the code off of but I haven't had a chance to do it yet.
[t]dont state methods in results
[u]give value
[v]What is main message you want to get across.
[w]I stated that the Oyster Bay group produced significantly more broods at Oyster Bay and Fidalgo than did the other groups. I then want to go into further detail about the differences at each site.
[x]Should I place these graphs within the paper or as part of an appendix at the end. I like them because the clearly show spawning temperature threshold. I would also like to make a truncated form of this graph to overlay weekly brooder percentages for each site.
[y]there is no way those spikes are real
[z]your working on getting these to # of those that opened?
[aa]I would overlay this graph onto a truncated temperature graph for the same period.
[ab]not sure how this relates to data. would not these numbers need to refer to specific time point?
[ac]They are totals for the season instead of single time points.
[ad]could be same oysters (no way of knowing) so please describe in terms of time points
[ae]Do you want individual percentages of spawning for each populations at each site at each time point. If so we should considered a table as it would be less cluttered than a graph and I could high light things such as first spawn and peak spawn?
[af]table is fine
[ag]no commentary in results
[ah]name
[ai]add one sentence indicating the minimum size of brooder found at each site for each pop.
[aj]this is method
[ak]but not diff from rest of pop..
[al]My understanding is his has no relevance as population sizes varied accordingly?
[am]keep consistent how you cover sites in text. 1
[an]condense. Perhaps start with describing what was planned, i.e. the sentence below this paragraph. Then follow with the deviation from the plan at both Dabob (no viable place to hang the trays, but a perched embayment was used) and Oyster Bay (temporary stack loss, overexposure to high temp during sampling).
