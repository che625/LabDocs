Lineage and developmental patterns of DNA methylation in oysters




Abstract
To identify individual variation, paternal transmission, and developmental patterns of DNA methylation, high-resolution methylome characterization of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae was performed. Our data suggests DNA methylation patterns are potentially inherited, as methylation patterns are similar between males and their offspring. Differentially methylated loci between lineages and differing during development were identified. Lineage-specific differentially methylated loci (483) and loci differing in methylation during developmental (387) were found throughout the genome though preferentially located in transposable elements. Among loci that were differentially methylated across the three stages of development an increase in transposable element methylation among early larvae samples (72 hours post-fertilization) was observed. This could be associated with decreasing transcriptional noise during this stage of oyster development. Together this research indicates that oyster lineages are more similar in their DNA methylation patterns which could have evolutionary implications, particularly if these epigenetic patterns are independent of genetic structure. 




Introduction
DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is ubiquitous across many eukaryotes, with patterns and functions variable across taxa. This epigenetic modification involves the addition of a methyl group to nucleotide motifs, usually CpG dinucleotides, that is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation can alter gene expression without modifying the underlying nucleotide sequence, and function in mammals to suppress transcription through increased methylation among promoter regions (Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000).  In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for development and differentiation of organs and tissues (Okano et al. 1999). Likewise, mutations of DNA methyltransferase in mammals results in delays in development and potential lethality (Li et al. 1992). 
        In contrast to the densely methylated mammalian genomes, several invertebrate species display gene-body methylation with overall low to intermediate levels of methylation. In invertebrates, it has been proposed that DNA methylation among genes may be associated with alternative splicing events (ie  honey bee (Lyko et al. 2010) and Nasonia (Park et al. 2011). Methylation among gene bodies has also been shown to have a positive relationship with transcriptional activity in oysters (Gavery and Roberts, 2013; Olson and Roberts, 2014). Currently there is not a complete understanding of how DNA methylation regulates genome activity in invertebrates  though it appears to be distinct from mechanisms observed in mammals and like varies across species. 
             From the limited studies that have focused on invertebrates, research has shown that similar to mammals, DNA methylation has important regulatory functions during early development. For example, research on the honey bee, Apis mellifera found DNA methylation to be abundant in the genome, with methylation being associated with altered gene expression resulting in bee caste differentiation (Elango et al. 2009; Kucharski et al. 2008). Furthermore, DNA methylation has been shown to regulate gene expression during Octopus vulgaris development, particularly during the first paralarval stage that includes significant morphological changes (Diaz-Freije et al. 2014). The first indication that methylation was an important regulator of development in C. gigas was by Riviere et. al (2013), who found treatment with 5-Aza-cytidine leads to developmental alterations and abnormal phenotypes in oysters. 
        Despite the essential role methylation plays in development, there is limited information on individual variation in DNA methylation patterns among invertebrates and particularly how any methylation information might be passed on to offspring.  Furthermore, we do not have a full understanding of DNA methylation changes that occur during invertebrate development. In order to better understand to what degree DNA methylation patterns are heritable, variable between individuals, and the changes that occur during C. gigas development, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in organisms at three developmental stages: gametes and larval oysters (72 and 120 hours post-fertilization) from two lineages. 
We were surprised to find similar methylation patterns between oyster lineages rather than among developmental stages, thus suggesting that the spermatozoa methylome information could be transmitted oyster larvae and/or that methylation does not vary dramatically between tissue type or life history stage. Methylation differences between oyster lineages and developmental stages were identified, and these differentially methylated loci were predominantly located among transposable elem[a]ents. While we still do not understand why a majority of differentially methylated loci are present among transposable elements, further explorations into the roles of methylation and gene expression during oyster development will help elucidate our understanding of epigenetic regulation during oyster development.










Methods


Experimental Design
Oysters (two males and a single female) were collected from Oakland Bay, South Puget Sound, WA. Oysters were strip spawned by scoring the gonad tissue with a sterile razor blade and rinsing out gametes with sterile seawater. Oocytes were incubated for 30 minutes in sterile seawater and 2 million oocytes each were placed into two separate plastic containers. Spermatozoa diluted in sterile seawater (1mL) from each male were used to fertilized oocytes. Fertilization was confirmed by examining polar bodies in cells under a compound microscope. 
Larvae were kept in static tanks (100L) up to 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf).  Counts of oyster larvae were performed at 120 hpf to confirm normal development. Samples for DNA methylation analyses were taken from spermatozoa prior to fertilization, and oyster larvae collected at days 72 hpf and 120 hpf.  Larvae samples were taken by filtering on a 20µm screen. All samples were preserved in 95% ethanol. For simplicity the spermatozoa and corresponding larvae samples are referred to as lineage #1 and lineage #3 based on paternity.


Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Genomic DNA was extracted using DNAzol according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). High molecular weight genomic DNA (6 ug), was used to prepare libraries (6) for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Briefly, DNA was fragmented to an average length of 250 bp in an AFA microtube using a Covaris S2 (Covaris Inc Woburn, MA) with the following settings: duty cycle 20%, intensity of 4.0, cycles per burst 200, for 60 seconds. Fragment size resulting from DNA shearing was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Libraries were constructed using the Paired-End DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with standard protocols. Unmethylated Lambda DNA (0.5%) (Promega Co. Madison, WI) was added to the each sample prior to fragmentation and library construction to serve as a measure of bisulfite conversion efficiency. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 72 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Library construction and sequencing was performed by the High Throughput Genomics Center (htSEQ, Seattle, WA).  
Quality filtered bisulfite sequencing reads from the six libraries were separately mapped to the Crassostrea gigas genome (version GCA_000297895.1; Zhang et al. 2012) using Bisulfite Sequencing Mapping Program BSMAP v2.74 (Xi and Li 2009). Resulting alignment from mapping bisulfite treated reads was analyzed with methratio, a Python script that accompanies BSMAP. Parameters for methratio included reporting loci with zero methylation ratios (-z), combining CpG methylation ratios on both strands (-g) and only using unique mappings (-u). Only CpG loci covered by at least 3 sequenced reads were considered for further analysis. Data can be accessed and computational analysis performed as described via the GitHub repository (see http://goo.gl/hQmKtd). This IPython notebook includes all steps necessary for download and analyses of DNA methylation data.


Global DNA Methylation Comparison
Whole-genome DNA methylation correlation and clustering were performed using the methylKit 0.9.2 (Akalin et al. 2012) in R v3.0.3.  Pairwise coefficients were calculated by Pearson’s correlation scores to create a matrix. Hierarchical clustering was performed using 1-Pearson’s correlation distance of the six methylation profiles. 


Differentially Methylated Loci 
To characterize DNA methylation patterns that changed during development we identified loci that 1) were the same across biological replicates (i.e. lineage #1 and #3) and 2) differed in methylation levels among the sperm and two larval samples (72 hpf and 120 hpf). Specifically, similarity in biological replicates was defined as individual methylation ratio was less than 0.2 different from the mean methylation ratio. Differences through development were identified as any loci where the mean methylation ratio of biological replicates varied greater than 0.4 for any comparison. 
To examine lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns we found similarities among the male gamete sample to its progenies, and then compared methylation differences between the two lineages (Lineages 1 and 3). Loci were determined to be similar throughout a lineage when the methylation level at a loci was less than 0.2 from mean across the three samples (ie sperm, 72 hpf, 120 hpf). Loci were determined to be different between lineages when the mean methylation level for a lineage was at least 0.3 different that mean of other lineage (Figure 1).
All loci determined to be different during development and across lineages were characterized with respect to overlapping genomic features (putative promoter, gene, transposable element) using Bedtools (i.e., intersectBed) (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Putative promoters were defined as 1kb regions upstream from transcription start sites and transposable elements were identified using RepeatMasker and the Transposable Element Protein Database (Smit et al., 1996-2010). A test for equality of proportions was performed to determine if the proportion of differentially methylated loci within transposable elements was different from what would be expected if CpGs were preferentially located among transposable elements (p-value <0.05 was considered significant).

Results


Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Bisulfite treated DNA Sequence reads are available (NCBI Sequence Read Archive). Sodium bisulfite conversion efficiency was estimated to be 99.9% based on analysis of lambda phage DNA. The number covered cytosines in the oyster genome ranged from 2.6x107 to 5.3x107 across libraries. Using a 3x coverage threshold, a majority of cytosines (75-78%) were determined to be unmethylated (methylation ratio = 0), with 15-18% of the CpG dinucleotides methylated (methylation ratio  0.5).




Genome-wide DNA Methylation Comparison
Sample correlation and clustering was performed to assess relationships on a genome-wide scale. Sperm and respective progeny exhibited high correlation with a pair-wise Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r)  0.84 for both lineages. These relationships are also evident in hierarchical clustering (Figure 2). Both male gamete samples were more similar in their methylation profiles to respective 120 hpf larvae.

Lineage-specific and Developmental Differences
We identified differentially methylated loci (DMLs) that were classified as regions that differed in methylation levels either among the two lineages (lineage-specific differentially methylated loci) or during oyster developmental stages (developmentally different loci). A total of 483 lineage-specific loci were identified among gamete and larval samples. Differences among oyster developmental stages were also classified revealing a total of 387 differentially methylated loci (Table 1). These loci were classified with respect to oyster genomic regions (Promoter Regions, Genes, Transposable Elements) and compared to the frequency of CpG dinucleotides located among these regions (Figure 3). A majority of differentially methylated loci were found among transposable elements relative to the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the oyster genome. The proportion of transposable elements among differentially methylated loci (15.68% average) was almost three times higher relative to all CpGs (5.87%) across the oyster genome. The observed distribution of lineage-specific loci within transposable elements (2= 97.8728, df= 1, p = 2.2e-16) was significantly different than what would be expected if CpGs were preferentially located among transposable elements. Similarly, the observed distribution of developmentally different loci within transposable elements (2= 53.2826, df= 1, p = 2.889e-13) was significantly different than what would be expected if CpGs were preferentially located among transposable elements. Furthermore, a high proportion of Helitron transposons were observed among lineage-specific differentially methylated loci, compared to the distribution of transposable elements differing during development.

Discussion
Although DNA methylation has been previously quantified in C. gigas, this study represents the first time single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes have been generated for both oyster spermatozoa and larval samples from multiple spawns. This research not only provides new information on DNA methylation patterns during oyster development, but also examines the degree of heritability and individual variability of these epigenetic marks. Interestingly, our research provides the first indication that there are different epigenetic patterns that may differ among oyster lineages. 


Overall genome methylation levels ranged from about 15-18% in the oyster genome with interspersed regions of both methylated and unmethylated DNA in both male gamete and larval samples. This proportion of CpG methylation falls within the range of that previously reported for oyster male gonad tissue (Olson and Roberts, 2014) and oyster gill tissue (Gavery and Roberts, 2013). These findings indicate that overall genome methylation in C. gigas is at an intermediate level and suggests that DNA methylation levels do not significantly vary between multiple cell types and life history stages. This is similar to what has been described in global 5-methylcytosine content during different stages of Ciona intestinalis development (Suzuki et al. 2013). DNA methylation primarily occurs among CpG dinucleotides and was predominantly located in gene bodies in both adult and larval oysters, which is consistent with other invertebrates (Suzuki et al. 2007, Lyko et al. 2010, Suzuki et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2014, Fneich et al. 2013) (Olson and Roberts, 2014 b)[e][f]. 


Hierarchical clustering indicated that oyster lineages are more similar in their DNA methylation patterns, as opposed to distinct developmental stages having similar methylation profiles. These findings indicate that DNA methylation patterns are inherited from parents to their progeny[g], as methylation profiles were specific to oyster lineages. If epigenetic marks are indeed heritable, this mechanism has significant implications for evolutionary change and epigenetic variation could potentially provide a new basis for selection. It has even been proposed that epigenetic variation may compensate for a decrease in genetic variation in species such as sparrows (Shrey et al. 2012). It is therefore worth assessing relationships between genetic and epigenetic variation, and several studies have done this in vertebrate and plant populations (Liu et al. 2012; Herrera and Bazaga 2010). Limited studies have focused on invertebrates, but research by Jiang et al. 2013 has investigated the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations in two groups of C. gigas, a base population and third generation mass selection population. This study demonstrated genetic differentiation between the oyster mass selection populations, but did not find overall epigenetic variation (Jiang et al. 2013). Despite this, a significant correlation was observed between genetic and epigenetic profiles, with few individuals having similar genetic but distinct epigenetic profiles (Jiang et al. 2013). Although our study did not include any genetic analyses, our findings suggest unique epigenetic profiles differentiated by lineages which may be different than genetic profiles. If further investigations confirm that epigenetic variation is different from genetic variation, this research could have significant implications for evolutionary processes. 


Genome-wide methylation comparisons suggest parental genomic imprinting as a feature during C. gigas development, as clustering analysis revealed that oyster sperm and larvae have extremely similar methylation profiles that were distinguishable among oyster lineages (Figure 2). Furthermore, we observed a high proportion of helitron transposons among lineage-specific DMLs, and helitron insertions have been previously implicated in gene imprinting during plant development (Gehring et al. 2009) Genomic imprinting describes the epigenetic mechanism in which specific genes are differentially expressed in a parent-of-origin manner. In many species, it has been shown that DNA methylation imprints expression of genes in a parent-specific manner (Reik et al. 1987; Li et al. 1993; Reik and Walter, 2001), suggesting the key role methylation plays in[h][i][j][k][l] genomic imprinting. The phenomenon of genomic imprinting and lineage-specific methylation patterns has been described in few other invertebrates. For example, recent research by Drewell et al. (2014) found extensive germline-specific methylation patterns in the honey bee Apis mellifera, suggesting epigenetic marks in gametes are specific to parents. Similarly, DNA methylation has been found to be responsible for genomic imprinting and parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation patterns in mealybugs (Planococcus citri) (Bongiorni and Prantera, 2003). These limited studies have focused on invertebrates, however genomic imprinting is well documented in mammals and vertebrates. Recent research on zebrafish development distinguished between embryo and fully developed tissue types solely based on global methylation patterns, indicating the presence of tissue and developmental stage specific methylation profiles (McGaughey et al. 2014). Studies on zebrafish development have also indicated that embryos inherit the methylation profile of spermatozoa rather than oocyte (Jiang et al. 2013, Potok et al. 2013). Although our study did not examine the oocyte methylome, our results are consistent with these findings in which we found parent-of-origin effects during oyster development. 


Recent research has examined the role of DNA methylation in developmental activity of the Pacific oyster. Riviere et al. (2013) first observed developmental alterations in C. gigas after the addition of 5-Aza-cytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. This was further supported by identifying considerable stage-specific differences in total methylation levels during oyster early development, indicating that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in oyster embryogenesis (Riviere et al. 2013). [m][n][o]Similarly, in investigating genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in developmental stages of the honey bee Apis mellifera, research found significant differences in the level of methylation between sample types (Drewell et al. 2014).Although our results may conflict with these studies, as we observed constant levels of global methylation during oyster development, it is likely that inconsistencies are due to different sampling timelines or a differing role of methylation throughout C. gigas early embryogenesis. Specifically, research by Riviere et al. (2013) was focused on the first 24 hours post-fertilization, and our samples were taken during the first week of oyster development. These differences may also be attributable to different methodologies, as our study characterized genome-wide methylation where Riviere et al. (2013) specifically examined homeobox genes. [p][q][r] 




Our research identified loci responsible for lineage and developmental differences in DNA methylation, and these DMLs were classified with respect to oyster genomic regions. Interestingly, the loci specific to lineages and differing during development were predominant among transposable elements[s]. Recent research on zebrafish development has found that embryonic and fully developed tissue types have distinct methylation profiles, particularly among repetitive ele[t][u]ments (McGaughey et al. 2014).  As DNA methylation among transposable elements is known to be dynamic during vertebrate development, McGaughey et al. 2014 found the three major classes of repetitive elements (LINEs, SINEs, and LTRs) had different methylation patterns in embryos versus fully developed zebrafish. Specifically, fully developed tissue types had increased methylation among LTRs and decreased methylation among SINEs relative to embryonic tissues (McGaughey et al. 2014). Although we did not find the repetitive elements LTRs and SINEs to have different methylation patterns among tissues, we did observe a majority of DMLs among transposable elements. This is consistent with previous research on plants, in which DNA methylation has been associated with transcriptional silencing of transposons in the truffle plant Tuber malanosporum (Montanini et al. 2014). Furthermore, genome-wide analyses have shown that transposable elements are primarily methylated in Maize plant genomes, whereas in vertebrates most exons are also methylated (Rabinowicz et al. 2003). Rabinowicz et al. (2003) found higher levels of methylation specifically among transposable elements, proposing that DNA methylation plays an essential role in epigenetically silencing plant transposons in order to protect their genes. This is due to the fact that transposable element silencing is typically a consequence of DNA methylation (Yoder et al. 1997), as transcription is prevented by DNA hypermethylation (Liu and Schmid 1993). The mechanism of DNA methylation silencing transposons has been well studied in numerous plant species but remains underexplored among invertebrates. Limited information is available about the methylation status of transposable elements in invertebrate species, and what is available suggests transposons are generally unmethylated and contain similar levels of methylation to neighboring DNA (Suzuki and Bird, 2008). 




Interestingly, we found that in loci differentially methylated during development, higher levels of methylation were present among transposable elements in younger larvae[v][w] (72 hours post-fertilization)[x].  This is a time in which oysters have just finished metamorphosis from trochophores into D-larvae, a stage which they will remain for another 5 days (Fabioux et al. 2004)[y]. Due to the fact that transposable elements are silenced as a result of CpG methylation (Yoder et al. 1997), we hypothesize that methylation among transposable elements in DMLs may represent a repression in transposable element activity and transcriptional silencing. It is possible that a great number of transposable elements in 72 hour post-fertilization larvae are epigenetically silenced by an increase in methylation at this dynamic life history stage in order to control transcription of genes during oyster early development.[z][aa] Thus, movement of transposable elements to new sites in the genome could have a negative effect on early larvae, which are especially vulnerable around metamorphosis. It would be beneficial to silence TEs at early and vulnerable developmental stages in order to decrease transcriptional noise, which could disrupt C. gigas development or cause mutations by excision or insertion. We therefore propose that epigenetic metastability of transposable elements in C. gigas young larvae is preventing potential disruption of early development in C. gigas.




In this study we provide the first genome-wide shotgun bisulfite sequencing of DNA methylation in mollusc that focused on characterizing lineage and developmental differences in methylation during embryogenesis. We found that DNA methylation targets oyster development in a lineage-specific manner. This is indicative of genomic imprinting, in which DNA methylation information is being inherited from parents to their progeny in a parent-of-origin matter.  Methylation patterns were also similar among the three time points examined (sperm, 72hpf, 120hpf), suggesting common roles for DNA methylation in C. gigas development. These results also suggest that DNA methylation does not likely play tissue or stage-specific roles in oyster development. We identified loci responsible for differences in methylation among lineages and during development, and a majority of DMLs were found within transposable elements considering the distribution of CpGs in the oyster genome. Together, these data suggest that one role of DNA methylation during oyster development is to control transposon activity and silencing, as is commonly seen in plant species. This mechanism would decrease background transcriptional noise from transposons, preventing potential developmental abnormalities from occurring during the critical early stages of oyster development. DNA methylation is therefore a dynamic and complex process, which may play differing roles depending on the taxa, context, and life history stage of an organism.

[a]so the 72hpf explanation has nothing to do with difference in lineagae? need to acknowlege do not know what's going on
[b]why two figures
[c]You asked to also see plots that weren't 100% stacked bars
[d]Think we should go with 100% stacked but wanted you to see both for comparison
[e]what is this?
[f]figshare IGV tracks. But now that I think about it, probably don't need to include because we have the notebook entry
[g]should be able to bring in other oyster paper that does msalfps. 
- wild population of other inverts
and quantitative # that provides diff between two males.
[h]come up with another sentence in front as topic sentence..
[i]cannot tell where you are going.
[j]Still cannot tell.
[k]?
[l]Wanted to discuss genomic imprinting in this paragraph, and how our data suggests evidence for this occurring in oysters
[m]This is good though might flip emphasis
[n]?
[o]I think we need to compare our results to Riviere- because they are contradictory and explain some reasons for the differences. But this may not be necessary?
[p]This is good though might flip emphasis
[q]?
[r]I think we need to compare our results to Riviere- because they are contradictory and explain some reasons for the differences. But this may not be necessary?
[s]I do not think all transposable elements have repeats
[t]maybe a little more....
[u]yep still thinking more
[v]this is a second sentence, that needs  to offer further explanation
[w]done
[x]any stastics? if not do not include in abstract or intro
[y]this does not go in introduction
[z]Generally speaking- I am not convinced that 72hpf is more vulnerable thann 120hpf
[aa]hopefully this explanation helps- if not we can reevaluate or cut this hypothesis
[ab]get refs in order
