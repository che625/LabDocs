Characterizing whole genome DNA methylation patterns during Crassostrea gigas early development




Abstract
Epigenetics and DNA methylation summary... Genome-wide shotgun bisulfite sequencing was conducted on six samples
X genes show methylation differences between male gametes and progeny- reveals the complexity of methylation patterns.
 The larvae methylome is inherited paternally, as DNA methylation patterns are similar between males and their offspring.  


Introduction
-Importance of epigenetics and methylation in development and embryogenesis, cellular differentiation
-Variability in methylation function depending on genomic context- promoter regions=repressed transcription, gene bodies= transcription and DNA splicing
-Describe basics of oyster reproduction and embryogenesis (development from zygote to larvae takes x days, x days in adulthood, how many larvae produced)
-Characteristics that make oysters ideal model organisms to study epigenetic mechanisms on developmental processes
-Knowledge on how information passed to offspring is limited (heritability vs individual variability), and a full understanding of this requires high-resolution genome wide methylation characterization 
-To understand if larvae obtain DNA methylation information from their parents we did WGBS of sperm and larvae (and eggs) to provide a comprehensive characterization of methylation on a genome-wide scale (status and dynamics of DNA methylation at a base-pair resolution in sperm and larvae samples- profile of gametes and early development- mature sperm and larvae following fertilization)
-Interested in whether genes are targeted by DNA methylation in a lineage or developmental -specific manner
-Spermatozoa methylome is inherited by oyster larvae- spermatozoa methylation patterns more similar to larvae versus each other 




Methods
Experimental Design and Sample Collection 
Oyster (two males and a single female) were collected from Oakland Bay, South Puget Sound, WA.  Oysters were strip spawned by scoring the gonad tissue with a sterile razor blade and rinsing out gametes with sterile seawater.  Oocytes were incubated for 30 minutes in sterile seawater and 2 million oocytes each were placed into two separate plastic containers. Spermatozoa diluted in sterile seawater (1ml) from each male were used to fertilized oocytes. Fertilization was confirmed by examining polar bodies in cells under a compound microscope. 
Larvae were kept in static tanks (100l) for 5 days post-fertilization.  Counts of oyster larvae were performed at 5 days post-fertilization to examine mortality, hatching rate, and check for potential ciliate contaminants[a]. Samples for DNA methylation analysis were taken from oyster oocytes and spermatozoa prior to fertilization, and oyster larvae collected at days 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) and 120 hpf.  Larvae samples were taken by filtering on a 20µm screen. All samples were preserved in 95% ethanol. For simplicity the spermatozoa and corresponding larvae samples will be referred to as lineage #1 and lineage #3 based on paternity.


Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Genomic DNA was extracted using DNAzol according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). High molecular weight genomic DNA (6 ug), confirmed by gel electrophoresis, was used to prepare libraries (6) for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Briefly, DNA was fragmented to an average length of 250 bp in an AFA microtube using a Covaris S2 (Covaris Inc Woburn, MA) with the following settings: duty cycle 20%, intensity of 4.0, cycles per burst 200, for 60 seconds.  Fragment size resulting from DNA shearing was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Libraries were constructed using the Paired-End DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with standard protocols. Unmethylated Lambda DNA (0.5%) (Promega Co. Madison, WI) was added to the each sample prior to fragmentation and library construction to serve as a measure of bisulfite conversion efficiency.[b]  DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 72 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Library construction and sequencing was performed by the High Throughput Genomics Center (htSEQ, Seattle, WA).  
Quality filtered bisulfite sequencing reads from the six libraries were separately mapped to the Crassostrea gigas genome (version GCA_000297895.1; Zhang et al. 2012) using Bisulfite Sequencing Mapping Program BSMAP v2.74 (Xi and Li 2009). Resulting alignment from mapping bisulfite treated reads was analyzed with methratio, a Python script that accompanies BSMAP. Parameters for methratio included reporting loci with zero methylation ratios (-z), combining CpG methylation ratios on both strands (-g) and only using unique mappings (-u). Only CpG loci covered by at least 3 sequenced reads were considered for further analysis. Data can be accessed computational analysis performed as described via the GitHub repository: olson_larv (tmp-http://goo.gl/lncbKL). This includes …….[c]


Global DNA Methylation Comparison
Whole-genome DNA methylation correlation and clustering were performed using the methylKit 0.9.2 (Akalin et al. 2012) in R v3.0.3. Pairwise coefficients were calculated by Pearson’s correlation scores to create a matrix. Hierarchical clustering was performed using 1-Pearson’s correlation distance of the six methylation profiles. 


Differentially methylated loci 
To characterize DNA methylation patterns that changed during development we identified loci that 1) were the same across biological replicates (i.e. lineage 1 and 3) and 2) differed in methylation levels among the sperm and two larval samples (72hpf and 120hpf). Specifically, similarity in biological replicates was defined as individual methylation ratio was less than 0.2 different from mean methylation ratio. Differences through development were identified as any loci were mean methylation ratio of biological replicates varied greater than 0.4 for any comparison. 
To examine lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns we found similarities among the male gamete sample to its progenies, and then compared methylation differences between the two lineages (Lineages 1 and 3). Loci were determined to be similar throughout a lineage when a the methylation level at a loci was less than 0.2 from mean across the three samples (ie sperm, 70hpf, 150hpf). Loci were determined to be different between lineages when these loci where the mean methylation level for a lineage was at least 0.3 different that mean of other lineage.
All loci determined to be different during development and across lineage where characterized with respect to overlapping genomic feature (putative promoter, gene, transposable element) using Bedtools (Ref?) All code and data available in GITHUB>

Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Bisulfite treated DNA Sequence reads are available (NCBI Sequence Read Archive[d]). Sodium bisulfite conversion efficiency was estimated to be 99.999% based[e] on analysis of lambda phage DNA. Total number of aligned reads varied from  .
XXX - XXX[f].  The number covered cytosines in the oyster genome ranged from 26507310 to 53389886 across libraries. A majority of cytosines (x-x%) were unmethylated using a 3x coverage threshold.

Lineage and Developmental Differences
A total of 481 lineage-specific loci were identified among spermatozoa and larval samples. These loci were classified with respect to oyster genomic regions, and a majority of these loci were present among genes and transposable elements (Figure 3). Lineage-specific loci were found to be enriched for transposable elements relative to the frequency of transposable elements located among all CG dinucleotides in the oyster genome. Differences among oyster developmental stages were also classified and a total of 387 differentially methylated loci were identified. Similarly, a majority of these loci were present among genes and transposable elements, and and enrichment for transposable elements was observed among differentially methylated loci during development.  Transposable elements were classified to compare types and numbers of transposons specific to lineages and variable during oyster development. Tandem repeats were one of the highest occurring transposable elements along with long terminal repeats (LTR) Gypsy and Pao (Table/figure). Also present among transposable elements specific to oyster lineages and differentially methylated during development were long interspersed elements (LINE-1). Interestingly, the non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposable element (LINE RTE) usually found widely distributed in the genome, was not present among lineage-specific loci with only one occurrence among loci with developmental differences in DNA methylation.

Discussion
Genome-wide shotgun bisulfite sequencing was performed on six samples, including oyster male gametes and their progeny to illustrate the regulatory role of DNA methylation during oyster development. Although DNA methylation has been previously examined during oyster early development, this study represents the first time single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes have been generated for both oyster spermatozoa and larvae samples from the same lineages. DNA methylation has been previously quantified for C. gigas, however the role of methylation during oyster development remains unknown. This research represents the first high-resolution characterization of DNA methylation patterns during oyster development, including examining the degree of heritability and individual variability during oyster early development. 


This study provides a comprehensive profile of where DNA methylation occurs in the oyster genome, both in male gametes and their progeny. Overall methylation levels ranged from about 15-18% in the oyster genome with interspersed regions of both methylated and unmethylated DNA in both spermatozoa and larvae samples. This proportion of CpG methylation falls within the range of that previously reported for oyster male gonad tissue (Olson and Roberts, 2014) and oyster gill tissue (Gavery and Roberts, 2013). These findings indicate that overall genome methylation in C. gigas is at an intermediate level and suggests that DNA methylation does not significantly vary both among tissue types and during the first week of oyster development. Similar methylation patterns were observed across spermatozoa and larvae samples, indicating that DNA methylation does not significantly vary during development. DNA methylation was also predominantly located in gene bodies in both adult and larval oysters.
This is the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation in oysters from multiple lineages. Our study found that DNA methylation patterns are specific to oyster lineages, as larvae and their parents were highly correlated in their methylation profiles. This lineage-specific epigenetic marking in offspring suggests that methylation information is inherited from parents to their progeny. This is contrary to what we expected, as male gamete samples are composed of a single cell type and were hypothesized to have similar DNA methylation profiles. Compare here

The resulting methratio outputs were quality filtered to examine distribution of methylation. A CpG locus was considered methylated if it had at least 3x coverage and at least half the reads remained unconverted after bisulfite treatment.  Methylation ratios were calculated for individual loci for all seven samples. Total CpG dinucleotide methylation was determined by obtaining the number of methylated cytosines (3x coverage, ≥50% unconverted) divided by the total number of CpG dinucleotides covered from bisulfite sequencing.  Genome feature tracks were used to visualize and compare the distribution of methylation between oyster gametes and larval developmental stages. Genome feature tracks were obtained from the Ensembl metazoa database gene set GTF and GFF3 files for C. gigas containing both coding and non-coding genes (Kersey et al. 2013)... note [m]

All CpG loci were quality filtered to [p]compare whole DNA methylome profiles and identify developmental and lineage-specific methylation patterns. A CpG locus was considered methylated if it had at least 3x coverage and at least half the reads remained unconverted after bisulfite treatment. The methylation levels of CpG loci were calculated as values ranging 0-1 representing the corresponding level of methylation (0%-100%). According to these levels, CpG dinucleotides were considered either methylated (50% unconverted) or unmethylated (< 50% unconverted).

compared samples from the same progeny (i.e. The two lineages of male spermatozoa and their progeny). 


The package methylKit models the methylation of CpG loci within a logistic regression and was used for visualization of descriptive statistics among samples and generating scatter plots for DNA methylation level comparisons on a genome-wide scale[q]. [r]




Pair-wise Pearson’s correlation scores were calculated for all six samples.  The package methylKit was also used to perform hierarchical clustering of the seven methylation profiles using 1-Pearson’s correlation distance. Epigenetic differentiation between developmental stages and lineages was assessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots of methylation profiles for each sample followed by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA).[s]


Methylation profiles were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Thorvaldsdóttir et al. 2012 and Robinson et al. 2011). IGV was used to examine regions of methylation with respect to genomic features (introns, exons, and repetitive elements) and to visually compare methylation profiles among entire contigs. (Supplemental info- figshare http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1060465)[t]


 larvecompared methylation levels among combinations of male gamete and larvae samples. To test developmental differences in DNA methylation patterns among samples, we found similarities among the same time points, and then compared methylation differences from distinct developmental stages (i.e. examined the male spermatozoa, day 3 larvae, and day 5 larvae samples). For a loci to be called developmentally different it was required to fit into one of the following comparisons: spermatozoa versus day 3 larvae, spermatozoa versus day 5 larvae, or day 3 larvae versus day 5 larvae.  Methylation values of common loci between both lineages at the same developmental stage were averaged to obtain a representative value of the region during oyster development.  A standard deviation cutoff  0.2 and at least 30% difference in average methylation were used for determining developmental DNA methylation patterns. Differentially methylated loci involved in development were annotated to corresponding protein-coding genes using the Ensembl database imported from GigaDB (Fang et al. 2013) from the UniProtKB database to classify what genes are driving differences in methylation during oyster development.


These packages are dependent on Bioconductor packages GenomicRanges 1.14.4 and data.table 1.9.2.[u][v] The package methylKit uses a logistic regression for visualization and DNA methylation level comparisons on a genome-wide scale[w]. 




DMRs
In  addition     Pair-wise comparisons of methylation differences for each CpG loci were also performed for spermatozoa and larvae samples. A CpG site was considered a differentially methylated region (DMR) if the methylation level difference was larger than 0.2 (20% methylation difference) and a p-value less than 0.05 using Fisher’s exact test. A total of 15 pair-wise comparisons were performed to determine total number of DMRs between samples and assess the degree of differential methylation between developmental stages. Methylation of DMRs in oyster spermatozoa and larvae samples was characterized in relation to genomic features using genome feature tracks (Kersey et al. 2013). DMR location within genomic regions was determined using Bedtools (i.e., intersectBed) (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). To annotate corresponding DMRs located within genes, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (www.uniprot.org) and corresponding gene ontology (GO) terms were used to classify DMRs within genes involved in biological processes. DMRs were also annotated to GO slim terms to obtain a synopsis of ontology content. Enrichment analysis was performed to determine which genes involved in biological processes were over-represented in DMRs compared to the entire genome. (DAVID version 6.7; Huang et al. 2009 and Huang et al. 2009). Outputs from enrichment analysis were visualized in REViGO (Supek et al. 2011).
