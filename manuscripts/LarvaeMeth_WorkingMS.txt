Characterizing whole genome DNA methylation patterns during Crassostrea gigas early development




Abstract
Epigenetics and DNA methylation summary... We generated six single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes, including oyster male gametes and early larvae.
X genes show methylation differences between male gametes and progeny- reveals the complexity of methylation patterns.
 The larvae methylome is inherited paternally, as DNA methylation patterns are similar between males and their offspring.  


Introduction
-Importance of epigenetics and methylation in development and embryogenesis, cellular differentiation
-Variability in methylation function depending on genomic context- promoter regions=repressed transcription, gene bodies= transcription and DNA splicing
-Describe basics of oyster reproduction and embryogenesis (development from zygote to larvae takes x days, x days in adulthood, how many larvae produced)
-Characteristics that make oysters ideal model organisms to study epigenetic mechanisms on developmental processes
-Knowledge on how information passed to offspring is limited (heritability vs individual variability), and a full understanding of this requires high-resolution genome wide methylation characterization 
-To understand if larvae obtain DNA methylation information from their parents we did WGBS of sperm and larvae (and eggs) to provide a comprehensive characterization of methylation on a genome-wide scale (status and dynamics of DNA methylation at a base-pair resolution in sperm and larvae samples- profile of gametes and early development- mature sperm and larvae following fertilization)
-Interested in whether genes are targeted by DNA methylation in a lineage or developmental -specific manner
-Spermatozoa methylome is inherited by oyster larvae- spermatozoa methylation patterns more similar to larvae versus each other 




Methods
Experimental Design and Sample Collection 
Two males and a single female oyster were collected from Oakland Bay, South Puget Sound, WA.  Adult male oysters were offspring from the same spawn and the female oyster was unrelated and from a different spawn. Oysters were strip spawned by scoring the gonad tissue with a sterile razor blade and rinsing out gametes with sterile seawater (SSW).  Oocytes were incubated for 30 minutes in SSW and then 2 million oocytes each were placed into two separate 1L plastic containers. Spermatozoa diluted in 1mL of SSW (sperm concentration?) from each male were separately fertilized with the oocytes. The container volume was brought up to 800mL with SSW and allowed to sit for 30 minutes. Fertilization was confirmed by examining polar bodies in cells under a compound microscope. Fertilized oocytes were transferred to 100 liter tanks for the remainder of the experiment. [a]
Larvae were kept in static tanks and raised for 5 days post-fertilization.  Larvae were not fed for the duration of the experiment to remove any potential of microbial contamination during bisulfite sequencing.  Counts of oyster larvae were performed at 5 days post-fertilization to examine mortality, hatching rate, and check for potential ciliate contaminants.  Samples for DNA methylation analysis were taken from oyster oocytes and spermatozoa prior to fertilization, and oyster larvae were collected at days 3 and 5 post-fertilization.  Larvae samples were taken by filtering on a 20µm screen then scooped into a sterile microfuge tube. Approximately 1.15 million larvae were collected from each sample for DNA methylation analysis. All samples were preserved in 95% ethanol, immediately placed on ice then stored at -20°C until further processing.

Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Sample material was pelleted by spinning at 10,000g for 30 seconds at room temperature and decanting residual ethanol.  Genomic DNA was extracted using DNAzol according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). High molecular weight genomic DNA (6 ug) confirmed by gel elecrophoresis was used to prepare libraries (7) for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Unmethylated Lambda DNA (0.5%) (Promega Co. Madison, WI) was added to the each sample prior to fragmentation and library construction to serve as a measure of bisulfite conversion efficiency.  DNA was fragmented to an average length of 250 bp in an AFA microtube using a Covaris S2 (Covaris Inc Woburn, MA) with the following settings: Duty cycle 20%, intensity of 4.0, cycles per burst 200, for 60 seconds.  Fragment size resulting from DNA shearing was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Libraries were constructed using the Paired-End DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with standard protocols. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 72 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Library construction and sequencing was performed by the High Throughput Genomics Center (htSEQ, Seattle, WA).  
Quality filtered bisulfite sequencing reads from the six libraries were separately mapped to the Crassostrea gigas genome (version GCA_000297895.1; Zhang et al. 2012) using Bisulfite Sequencing Mapping Program BSMAP v2.74 (Xi and Li 2009). Resulting alignment from mapping bisulfite treated reads was analyzed with methratio, a Python script that accompanies BSMAP. Parameters for methratio included reporting loci with zero methylation ratios (-z), combining CpG methylation ratios on both strands (-g) and only using unique mappings (-u). Only CpG loci covered by at least 3 sequenced reads were considered for further analysis. Data can be accessed computational analysis performed as described via the GitHub repository: olson_larv (tmp-http://goo.gl/lncbKL). This includes …….


Global DNA Methylation Comparison
Whole-genome DNA methylation correlation and clustering were performed using the methylKit 0.9.2 (Akalin et al. 2012) in R v3.0.3. Similarities were visualized using correlation coefficients, hierarchical clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Pairwise coefficients were calculated by Pearson’s correlation scores to create a matrix. Hierarchical clustering was performed using 1-Pearson’s correlation distance of the six methylation profiles. PCA was performed and the variation was compared by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). 


Developmental Differences in DNA Methylation
To characterize DNA methylation patterns that changed during development we identified loci that 1) were the same across biological replicates (i.e. Lineage 1 and 2) and 2) differed in methylation levels between the sperm and two timepoints post-fertilization. Specifically, all data from the methratio analysis was imported into SQLShare (Howe et al. 2011) where specific queries[b] were performed. Methylation levels Similar methylation across biological replicates[c] (ie M1 day3 larvae and M3 day3 larvae) was determined if the standard deviation of the mean methylation level was  0.2 for these loci. Three pairwise comparisons were then made (sperm v day3, sperm v day5, day3 v day5) with a loci identified as different if average methylation was least 30%.

Lineage-specific DNA methylation
To examine lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns we found similarities among the male gamete sample to its progenies, and then compared methylation differences between the two lineages (male 1 and male 3 lineages). Loci were determined to be similar throughout a lineage when the standard deviation of the mean methylation level was  0.2 and if average methylation was least 30% different for these loci. Loci were determined to be different between lineages when the standard deviation was  0.2 and less than 30% difference in average methylation among lineages. Loci specific to a lineage were characterized with respect to oyster genomic features (exons, introns, and repetitive elements). Genome features were obtained from the Ensembl metazoa database gene set GTF and GFF3 files for C. gigas containing both coding and non-coding genes (Kersey et al. 2013).

Bisulfite treated DNA Sequencing (BS-Seq)
Bisulfite treated DNA Sequence reads[d] (Table 2) were produced and are available (NCBI Sequence Read Archive[e]).  The total paired end reads and single end reads mapping to the Crassostrea gigas genome were calculated from BSMAP (Table 2).  Sodium bisulfite conversion efficiency was estimated to be 99.999% based[f] on analysis of lambda phage DNA. Total CpG dinucleotide percent methylations were calculated for individual samples to compare amounts nuclear genome methylation (Table 1). Overall, methylation levels did not dramatically vary between developmental stages, and male methylation profiles were similar to their respective larvae.




CpG DNA Methylation 
The bisulfite sequencing effort provided ≥ 3x coverage for a portion of the 9.98 million CpGs in the oyster genome. A majority of the CpGs from all samples were not methylated in the oyster nuclear genome. This coverage threshold corresponds to 1,218,605 CpGs (M1) and 1,364,436 (M3) in spermatozoa, and 252,136 CpGs (T1D3), 874,962 CpGs (T1D5), 1,159,920 CpGs (T3D3) and 1,186,022 CpGs (T3D5) in larvae. A majority of cytosines from all samples were either unmethylated (3x coverage, 0% unconverted) or methylated (3x coverage, ≥50% unconverted).

Genome-wide Methylation Visualization
To explore whether DNA methylation information is inherited from parents, gamete and larvae sample similarity was assessed. Sample correlation and clustering was performed to assess relationships on a genome-wide scale and create scatterplots of the percent methylation scores. The R package methylKit was applied to compare methylation profiles from the male spermatozoa samples to their progenies (40,654 CpG sites). Examination of genome-wide methylation patterns of all stages revealed two distinct clusters (Figure 1). Males and their progenies exhibited high correlation between individuals with a pair-wise Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) > 0.82, indicating DNA methylation information may be inherited. Similar findings of heritable DNA methylation patterns were also revealed in hierarchical clustering of genome-wide methylation pattern clustering.  Despite being composed of a single cell type, male spermatozoa sample methylation profiles most closely resembled that of their progenies. This result is consistent with our findings that larvae have similar methylation profiles to their parents. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed two distinct groups, indicating that males and their progenies had similar methylation profiles. *add here about stats of PCA plots*

Lineage and Developmental Differences
A total of 481 lineage-specific loci were identified among spermatozoa and larval samples. These loci were classified with respect to oyster genomic regions, and a majority of these loci were present among genes and transposable elements (Figure 3). Lineage-specific loci were found to be enriched for transposable elements relative to the frequency of transposable elements located among all CG dinucleotides in the oyster genome. Differences among oyster developmental stages were also classified and a total of 387 differentially methylated loci were identified. Similarly, a majority of these loci were present among genes and transposable elements, and and enrichment for transposable elements was observed among differentially methylated loci during development.  Transposable elements were classified to compare types and numbers of transposons specific to lineages and variable during oyster development. Tandem repeats were one of the highest occurring transposable elements along with long terminal repeats (LTR) Gypsy and Pao (Table/figure). Also present among transposable elements specific to oyster lineages and differentially methylated during development were long interspersed elements (LINE-1). Interestingly, the non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposable element (LINE RTE) usually found widely distributed in the genome, was not present among lineage-specific loci with only one occurrence among loci with developmental differences in DNA methylation.

Discussion
1) lineage specific patterns more similar
        -sperm patterns similar to first finding- 
-distribution histograms: Methylated and non methylated regions (most not methylated and some highly methylated- illustrate that the same pattern in seen across patterns). Doesn’t change  during development
-papers where this is similar/dissimilar to compare (zebrafish)
2) discussion of DMLs during development
3) discussion of DMLs based on lineages
to our knowledge this is first time anyone has looked at TEs- correlation between DMRs and TEs (in plants?)


Conclusion- 


-Methylation primarily in gene bodies in both adult and larval oysters
-Distinct methylation patterns suggest lineage-specific epigenetic marking in offspring
-DNA methylation regulates development (similar to other species- examples)
-Potential roles for DNA methylation during oyster development
        -genomic imprinting: gene expression influenced by inheritance from parents
        -transient methylation of developmental genes- based on environmental influence instead of always being expressed (triggered by signals from the environment)

The resulting methratio outputs were quality filtered to examine distribution of methylation. A CpG locus was considered methylated if it had at least 3x coverage and at least half the reads remained unconverted after bisulfite treatment.  Methylation ratios were calculated for individual loci for all seven samples. Total CpG dinucleotide methylation was determined by obtaining the number of methylated cytosines (3x coverage, ≥50% unconverted) divided by the total number of CpG dinucleotides covered from bisulfite sequencing.  Genome feature tracks were used to visualize and compare the distribution of methylation between oyster gametes and larval developmental stages. Genome feature tracks were obtained from the Ensembl metazoa database gene set GTF and GFF3 files for C. gigas containing both coding and non-coding genes (Kersey et al. 2013)... note [l]

All CpG loci were quality filtered to [o]compare whole DNA methylome profiles and identify developmental and lineage-specific methylation patterns. A CpG locus was considered methylated if it had at least 3x coverage and at least half the reads remained unconverted after bisulfite treatment. The methylation levels of CpG loci were calculated as values ranging 0-1 representing the corresponding level of methylation (0%-100%). According to these levels, CpG dinucleotides were considered either methylated (50% unconverted) or unmethylated (< 50% unconverted).

The package methylKit models the methylation of CpG loci within a logistic regression and was used for visualization of descriptive statistics among samples and generating scatter plots for DNA methylation level comparisons on a genome-wide scale[p]. [q]




Pair-wise Pearson’s correlation scores were calculated for all six samples.  The package methylKit was also used to perform hierarchical clustering of the seven methylation profiles using 1-Pearson’s correlation distance. Epigenetic differentiation between developmental stages and lineages was assessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots of methylation profiles for each sample followed by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA).[r]


Methylation profiles were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Thorvaldsdóttir et al. 2012 and Robinson et al. 2011). IGV was used to examine regions of methylation with respect to genomic features (introns, exons, and repetitive elements) and to visually compare methylation profiles among entire contigs. (Supplemental info- figshare http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1060465)[s]


 larvecompared methylation levels among combinations of male gamete and larvae samples. To test developmental differences in DNA methylation patterns among samples, we found similarities among the same time points, and then compared methylation differences from distinct developmental stages (i.e. examined the male spermatozoa, day 3 larvae, and day 5 larvae samples). For a loci to be called developmentally different it was required to fit into one of the following comparisons: spermatozoa versus day 3 larvae, spermatozoa versus day 5 larvae, or day 3 larvae versus day 5 larvae.  Methylation values of common loci between both lineages at the same developmental stage were averaged to obtain a representative value of the region during oyster development.  A standard deviation cutoff  0.2 and at least 30% difference in average methylation were used for determining developmental DNA methylation patterns. Differentially methylated loci involved in development were annotated to corresponding protein-coding genes using the Ensembl database imported from GigaDB (Fang et al. 2013) from the UniProtKB database to classify what genes are driving differences in methylation during oyster development.


These packages are dependent on Bioconductor packages GenomicRanges 1.14.4 and data.table 1.9.2.[t][u] The package methylKit uses a logistic regression for visualization and DNA methylation level comparisons on a genome-wide scale[v]. 




DMRs
In  addition     Pair-wise comparisons of methylation differences for each CpG loci were also performed for spermatozoa and larvae samples. A CpG site was considered a differentially methylated region (DMR) if the methylation level difference was larger than 0.2 (20% methylation difference) and a p-value less than 0.05 using Fisher’s exact test. A total of 15 pair-wise comparisons were performed to determine total number of DMRs between samples and assess the degree of differential methylation between developmental stages. Methylation of DMRs in oyster spermatozoa and larvae samples was characterized in relation to genomic features using genome feature tracks (Kersey et al. 2013). DMR location within genomic regions was determined using Bedtools (i.e., intersectBed) (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). To annotate corresponding DMRs located within genes, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (www.uniprot.org) and corresponding gene ontology (GO) terms were used to classify DMRs within genes involved in biological processes. DMRs were also annotated to GO slim terms to obtain a synopsis of ontology content. Enrichment analysis was performed to determine which genes involved in biological processes were over-represented in DMRs compared to the entire genome. (DAVID version 6.7; Huang et al. 2009 and Huang et al. 2009). Outputs from enrichment analysis were visualized in REViGO (Supek et al. 2011).
